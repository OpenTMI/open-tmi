https://github.com/toymachiner62/node-mongo-seeds

usage:
(1.) get node-mongo-seeds: "npm install -g node-mongo-seeds"
2. .json files in /seeds folder contain database collections. Collection names are the same as the filename.
3. run "seed" in project root anytime you want to set up the db collections (destroys old collections of the same name)
